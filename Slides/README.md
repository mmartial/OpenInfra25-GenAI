# Simplified Slides

A "Printed" version (generated from Chrome using the "Print to PDF" feature) is available as the [OpenInfra25-GenAI.pdf](./OpenInfra25-GenAI.pdf) file.

Those slides are designed to be used with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) in [Full Setup](https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup) to support the "External Markdown" feature. The source for the slides are found in the few Markddown files linked from the `index.html` file.
