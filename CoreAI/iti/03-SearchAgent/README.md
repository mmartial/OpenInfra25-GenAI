## About

This project demonstrates a tool-using LLM agent that can call a web search tool and route results through an LLM to answer queries.

This version was modified to use Ollama and Perplexity's OpenAI API.
Place the needed [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/api-key-management) and [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.com/web-search) API keys in the `.env` file.

High-level steps:

1. Set up the LLM client and load API keys/config.
2. Define a web search tool and a simple text fetch/summarize helper.
3. Agent loop: the LLM plans actions, chooses a tool, executes it, and observes the result (tool â†’ observation).
4. Retrieve and summarize: aggregate top search hits, extract snippets, and compress into a focused context.
5. Synthesize the final answer: the LLM uses the gathered context to produce a grounded response (often with links/citations).
