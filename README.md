# OpenInfra25-GenAI

This repository contains the configuration files for the OpenInfra 2525 Europe "Open-Source GenAI on OpenStack"presentation by Julian Pistorius, Mike Lowe and Martial Michel.

The `CoreAI` folder contains examples of Jupyter Notebooks to perform inference using local Large Language Model (LLM) as well as Stable Diffusion.

The `ComfyUI` folder contains a Docker Compose configuration to run ComfyUI, a graph-based user interface for building and running AI image generation workflows.

Those demos were run on Indiana University's JetStream platform, running OpenStack.
